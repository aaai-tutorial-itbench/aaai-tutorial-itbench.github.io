## Tentative Agenda

### January 20, 2026

---

#### 8:30 AM – 9:15 AM  
**Demonstration of AI Research Challenges in IT Diagnosis & Mitigation**  
- Planning and reasoning over heterogeneous, multi-modal data  
- Ensuring agent safety and reliability  
- Achieving robustness in stochastic and noisy environments  
- Coordinating multi-agent collaboration  

#### 9:15 AM – 10:30 AM  
**Developing a Baseline Multi-Agent System**  
- Build an **SREAgent** composed of specialized sub-agents  
- Explore agentic patterns such as *ReAct* for diagnosis and mitigation tasks  

#### 10:30 AM – 11:00 AM  
**Break**

#### 11:00 AM – 11:45 AM  
**Benchmarking with ITBench<sub>static</sub>**  
- Evaluate your SREAgent on a curated set of incident diagnosis scenarios  
- Receive automated scoring on root-cause identification accuracy  

#### 11:45 AM – 12:30 PM  
**Navigating ITBench<sub>live</sub>**  
- Deploy your agent in the interactive *ITBench<sub>live</sub>* environment  
- Tackle a simulated live incident and observe agent–environment interactions in real time
